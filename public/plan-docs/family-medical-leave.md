## Overview

PulseTel provides eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave per year in accordance with the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA). This policy outlines eligibility requirements, qualifying reasons for leave, and the process for requesting FMLA leave.

## Eligibility

- Have worked for PulseTel for at least 12 months
- Have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period immediately preceding the leave
- Work at a location where PulseTel employs at least 50 employees within a 75-mile radius

## Qualifying Reasons for Leave

Eligible employees may take FMLA leave for the following reasons:

1. **Birth and Care of a Newborn Child**
   - Leave must be completed within 12 months of the birth

2. **Placement of a Child for Adoption or Foster Care**
   - Leave must be completed within 12 months of the placement

3. **Care for an Immediate Family Member**
   - Care for a spouse, child, or parent with a serious health condition

4. **Employee's Own Serious Health Condition**

- Continuing treatment by a health care provider for:
  - A condition requiring absence for more than three consecutive calendar days
  - Pregnancy or prenatal care
  - Chronic conditions requiring periodic treatment
  - Permanent/long-term conditions requiring supervision
  - Multiple treatments for non-chronic conditions

## FMLA Leave Entitlement and Usage

- Eligible employees are entitled to up to 12 workweeks of leave during any 12-month period
- PulseTel uses a "rolling" 12-month period measured backward from the date an employee uses FMLA leave
- Leave may be taken continuously, intermittently, or on a reduced schedule when medically necessary
- Both spouses employed by PulseTel are limited to a combined total of 12 workweeks for birth, adoption, or care of a parent with a serious health condition

## Requesting FMLA Leave

1. **Notice Requirements**
   - Provide 30 days advance notice for foreseeable leave
   - For unforeseeable leave, notify your manager and HR as soon as practicable
   - Follow normal call-in procedures for reporting absences

2. **Required Documentation**
   - Complete an FMLA Leave Request Form available from HR
   - Provide medical certification within 15 calendar days of the request
   - Recertification may be required in certain circumstances

## Benefits During FMLA Leave

- **Health Insurance**: PulseTel maintains employee's health coverage under group health plan
- **Premium Payments**: Employee remains responsible for their portion of premium payments
- **Other Benefits**: Refer to specific benefit plans for continuation during unpaid leave
- **Accrual of Benefits**: Vacation and sick leave benefits do not accrue during unpaid FMLA leave

## Return to Work

- Employees returning from FMLA leave will be restored to their original or equivalent position with equivalent pay, benefits, and terms of employment
- Employees must provide fitness-for-duty certification prior to returning if leave was due to their own serious health condition
- "Key employees" (highest-paid 10% of workforce) may be denied restoration under certain circumstances

## Confidentiality

All medical information provided for FMLA purposes will be maintained in separate, confidential files in accordance with privacy regulations.
